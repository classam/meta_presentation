90 Slides : Presenting at VanJS for fun and <del>profit</del>
-------------------------------------------------------------

0. Why You Should Present at VanJS
----------------------------------

It's good for your career.

Expertise
> Presenting confidently on a topic is a step towards being an expert 
> in that topic. "You don't understand it until you can explain it to others.") 

It's fun. 

You're helping to develop Vancouver's tech scene. 

> Chances are, every person in this room knows at least one thing that I would find 
> fascinating.)
> When I presented about Vagrant, dozens of people asked me if I knew about 
> Docker. Someone present about THAT.)

1. Research & Write
-------------------

Start your presentation in a text editor.
 - Work with headings and points. 
 - Focus on key points. 

Answer "What" and "Why". 
 - What is the problem?
 - How does your solution solve it? 
 - What competitors exist? Why is your solution better? 
 - How do I get started? 

Tell Stories 
 - Stories build engagement. 

The Advice Talk
 - "Here's a pile of disconnected advice from a project we just did."
 - Treat every unit of advice like it's own mini-presentation: 
   - What was the problem?
   - How did you solve it?
   - How would you solve it in the future? 

Don't Accidentally Start a Holy War
 - Some topics are contentious enough to derail a whole presentation.  
 - Avoid these unless they are the entire point of your presentation. 
 - s(NoSQL vs. SQL, REST vs. RPC, CoffeeScript vs. ECMAScript)
 - Remember that just about every technology has a use case somewhere
 - Instead of "Don't use X", prefer "Here's why we didn't use X"

2. Getting A Talk Accepted
--------------------------

Send an e-mail or tweet to VanJS. Include your skeleton. (not your actual skeleton)

3. Slide Deck
-------------

Don't use Powerpoint. 
 - Powerpoint enables bad presentation habits, like:
   - Overloading slides
   - Underpreparing
   - Focusing on style/animations over clarity
 - Nobody has been impressed by a Powerpoint transition since 1997
 - Present from a text editor
 - Build a presentation webpage using reveal.js or bespoke.js
 - Present from a whiteboard 

Try to free yourself from your computer. 
 - Reveal.js Multiplex Mode
 - Click-navigated presentation and portable mouse

Focus on clarity.
 - Each point should have it's own slide.  
 - Don't keep your stories on your slides. 
   - Tell your stories and have your slides deliver the moral. 

Don't overcrowd slides. 

Don't pre-load concepts too far. (If you're talking about 5 things, don't
have thing 5 on the board while you're talking about thing 1)

Have a sense of humour. 
 - Try: tell a joke over a serious slide 
 - or talk seriously over a joke slide. 
 - don't force it

4. Practice
-----------

The _best_ way to improve your presentation is to practice it. 

You want to have much of your presentation memorized. Reading a presentation
    off of slides is the weakest sauce.  

Connect your laptop to your TV.
Record yourself delivering your presentation, with slides. 
 - If you're recording your TV, turn the backlight down to 0

5. Cut
------

As you memorize, cut down your slide deck. You can include every point, and lead-in
notes for every story that you tell, but as you develop your presentation, you can
cut your presentation down to just the most key points.

A 30-minute presentation should have about 90 slides, with a flip every 20 seconds. 

Weave.
 - Imagine yourself and your slide deck are separate presenters.
 - The only thing that should be on your slides are 
    _section headers_, 
    _key points_, 
    _examples_, and
    _jokes_.

5. Present
----------

- Eat

- Show up a little early. Get a feel for the equipment. 

- Bring a VGA cable, your own laptop, and power. 

- Be excited about your topic. 

- Breathe

- Pace yourself
